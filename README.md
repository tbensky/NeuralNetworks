# Introduction

This repo contains work the author did in an effort to learn about artififical neural networks (ANNs) during the early months of 2024. I didn't want to just jump in and start with PyTorch, as I wanted to understand the inner workings and structure of neural networks, including the backpropagation algorithm.

Here's what's here:

* ANNLoops: A dense-layer, neural network written with for-loops. This means a clumsy and slow model, but very instructive. For example, each neuron is treated as an entity (here a Python dictionary) as follows:
